I'm Martijn Wijnands,

35 yo, from Enschede NL.

I've worked as a BI Specialist up to now, and am keen to expand my knowledge into the realm of AE.

I also dabble in C# programming as a hobby (including the CLI), so all of this is not as intimidating to me as it might have been, had I just sticked to what my job required of me.
